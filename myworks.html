<h1>My Works</h1>
<div class="desc">
        During my free time I have started a part time hobby of creating custom 3D models, novelties and decorations made out of plastic. These made from the ground up by using 
        a 3d printer. All models are made to order and there is are infinite possibilities ranging from figurines, personalized gifts, accessories and even car parts. Contact me via whatsapp or
        any other link to discuss your idea for your your own 3D model which will be painted, glossed and finished. The possibilities are endless. Below is a selection of a few of my finished moulds.
